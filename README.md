## SchedIt: A Genetic Algorithm Based Timetable Scheduler

SchedIt is an intelligent timetable generation system that uses genetic algorithms to automatically create optimized, conflict-free schedules within seconds. It eliminates manual planning, reduces human errors, and ensures efficient time allocation for classes and events.

## About

SchedIt is an timetable automation system designed to generate optimized schedules using genetic algorithms. Traditional timetable creation is often slow, repetitive and prone to human errors especially when dealing with multiple subjects, faculty availability and time conflicts. SchedIt addresses these challenges by providing a automated solution that arranges all constraints to produce a valid and efficient timetable within seconds. The system uses genetic algorithm principles such as selection, crossover, and mutation to explore different timetable combinations and evolve towards the best possible solution. By continuously improving candidate schedules, SchedIt ensures minimal conflicts, balanced time distribution and optimal resource utilization. Built as a lightweight and user-friendly web application, SchedIt allows users to input subjects, slots, and constraints through a simple interface. Once submitted, the system processes the data and instantly generates a timetable. The platform aims to reduce manual workload, improve scheduling accuracy deliver a fast and reliable timetable generation experience.

## Features

- Implements a Genetic Algorithm for optimized timetable generation.
- Automatically creates conflict-free schedules in seconds.

## Results and Impact

SchedIt significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of timetable creation by automating the entire scheduling process. The system’s genetic algorithm ensures optimal subject slot allocation, minimizes conflicts and reduces the time required to generate a complete timetable from hours to just a few seconds. This leads to higher productivity and eliminates the frustration associated with manual scheduling. The automated approach also ensures fairness in time distribution and balanced workload. Generates error-free schedules without the need for extensive human intervention.
